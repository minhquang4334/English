Since came here, I was received a good education, knowlege and life skills. The first that I met everybody, I was speechless because I didn't feel confident about my language ability. And more, I always lose temper easily whenever problem is impending and 'give up' always come to my mind at that time. Thanks my beloved teacher for which taught us dedicatedly as well as encouraged and motivate learning english for us.
And To day, I no longer feel nervous when I give a speech in English in front of people. if we say 'goodbye', then I will desperately miss everybody. I will give this fond memories forever
